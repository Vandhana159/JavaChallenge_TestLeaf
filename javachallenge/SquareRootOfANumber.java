 * Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.
 * Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.
 * Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as pow(x, 0.5) or x ** 0.5.
 * Example 1:Input: x = 4,Output: 2
 * Example 2:Input: x = 8,Output: 2
 * Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
